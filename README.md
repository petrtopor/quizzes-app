# Quizzes Web application

This is the scaffolded project using VueJS, Nuxt and Vuetify, designed to demonstrate CRUD's of quizzes & users.

## 💿 Install

Set up the project using your preferred package manager (I preferred good old npm so all the instructions will be only on it). Use the following command to install the dependencies:

| Package Manager                                                | Command        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install)     | `npm install`  |

After completing the installation, your environment is ready for development.


## 💡 Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
npm run dev
```

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.
